# Windows task snippets

This repo collects snippets of ready-to-use code that accomplish small but useful tasks of
 interest to Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app developers. These snippets represent
 simple solutions to common problems, and simple recipes to help you implement new app features.  

Each snippet includes the using 
statements that it requires, which you can add to the top of your file as needed.

Each snippet is written in C# unless otherwise indicated. 

For more UWP samples, see [Windows on GitHub](http://microsoft.github.io/windows/).
